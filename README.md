# PIPFNet
Polarized Prior Guided Fusion Network for Infrared Polarization Image

## Installation
[Python 3.8]

[Pytorch 1.9.0 ]

[cuda 11.4]

[cudnn 8.4.0]

## Datasetï¼šLDDRS
We use the [ LWIR DoFP Dataset of Road Scene (LDDRS)](https://github.com/polwork/LDDRS) as our experimental dataset.
Download LDDRS dataset from https: //github.com/polwork/LDDRS.
You can randomly assign infrared intensity and polarized images for training and testing in the following directories
```
|-- dataset
  |-- train
    |-- 0000
       |-- S0.png
       |-- rho.png
       |-- pd.png
    |-- 0001
    |-- ....
  |-- val
    |-- 0000
    |-- 0001
    |-- ....
  |-- test
    |-- 0000
    |-- 0001
    |-- ....
```    

## Train & Test
* After loading data according to the above directory, you can run `python train.py` and `python test.py` for training and testing respectively.

We will add information about the paper later.
